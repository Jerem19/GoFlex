This page will evolve as this research project develops. Feel free to give us your opinion and suggestions by writing to us: ",
			"goflex" : "The GOFLEX project is a European-level research project involving several electricity distributors and several universities. Our goal is to achieve better energy management, particularly renewable energy on the electricity grids. As the proportion of the latter increases, it is necessary to adapt with flexibility.",

			"consumptionElectTip" : "TIP: It’s interesting to monitor the ‘bottom’ consumption, that is, the band present at all times, including at night. A few tens of watt but 24h/24 can represent a significant part of energy in the end. Put your devices on switches to avoid stand-by.",

			"consumptionHeatPumpInfo" : "The measurement is taken on the heat pump supply by means of a sensor and the information is sent to the GOFLEX box by radio.",
			"consumptionHeatPumpTip" : "TIP: A heat pump is economical because it draws part of its energy from environment. The coefficient of performance (COP) is an indicator of how the heat pump works: a COP of 3 means that for every 1kWh of electricity used to operate the heat pump, there is 3kWh of useful thermal energy.",

			"insideTemperatureInfo": "This measurement is taken on a small battery-powered box and placed in your housing. You can move it but keep it in a room called a living room. Avoid placing it in the sun as the measurement will be distorted.",
			"insideTemperatureTip": "TIP: On average, one extra degree on your heating setpoint represents an additional 7% energy consumption. Check the temperatures of the living rooms: 23°C in the bathroom, 20°C in the living room, 17°C in the bedrooms and hallway.",
			"hotwaterTemperature": "Hot water temperature",
			"hotwaterTemperatureInfo": "This measurement is taken on the hotwater tank. In normal operation, you should distinguish between heating cycles.",
			"hotwaterTemperatureTip": "TIP: To avoid the risk of legionellosis, the hotwater tank for domestic hotwater should be regularly installed above 50° or even 55°. This doesn’t apply to balloons used only as a reserve for heating and whose water isn’t brought into contact with people.",

			"productionElectTip": "TIP: The ESR takes back energy at its official price. This does not include taxes (municipal and federal), nor the routing used to pay for the network. Therefore, a kWh purchased from the grid is more expensive than the kWh paid for the injection. It is therefore worthwhile to self-consume as much of it as possible.",
